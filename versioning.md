# Versioning #
The versioning system uses three numbers to define the version of the software:
* Major: system overhaul/big features added
* Minor: added feature(s)
* Patch: bugfix release

Which results in Major.Minor.Patch (f.e. 1.2.3).
A software version is represented by a tag on the Git repository, which is also linked to a commit and contains archive files.
